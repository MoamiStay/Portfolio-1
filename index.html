        <h3>TASK</h3>
        <p>
          Time: 5 weeks<br />
          Use a Wordpress API to pull data presented as blog-posts with each
          individual detail-page on your website. The website should also
          include a form with Javascript validation.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Include at least the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage</li>
          <li>Blog-post page</li>
          <li>Details page</li>
          <li>Contact page</li>
          <li>About page</li>
        </ul> -->
        <h3>PROCESS</h3>
        <p>
          I started by drawing wireframes, plan the design and finish
          a prototype in Figma.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried a new approach in HTML and CSS coding where I add all HTML and most CSS on a single page before moving on to the next. Compared to previous projects this seemed to work out better for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Simpler JS such as the top menu was added early in order to make sure it would work out the way I intended.
        </p>
        <h3>PERSONAL EVALUATION</h3>
        <p>
          there is still details that should be re-adjusted and some
          functionality is lacking, but all in all I think the project turned
          out satisfactory considering my current skill level as well as
          according to the expectations I had for myself.
        </p>


        <h3>GOING FORWARD</h3>
        <p>
          Although there is room for improvement in many areas, I believe the
          area I am the most lacking in lies in the technical aspects and
          functionality of the page. Improving my understanding of Javascipt and
          optimizing my code will be my priority going forward.

        <h3>TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
        <p>HTML CSS</p>
        <h3>TASK</h3>
        <p>
          Time: 4 weeks<br />
          Create a website where the target audience is primary and middle
          school children and families with young children. The website should
          be informative, engaging and encourage the viewers to visit the museum
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website should be responsive, attractive and easy to use on a
          variety of devices.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Should include at least 4-6 pages.</p> -->
        <h3>PROCESS</h3>
        <p>
          I started by collecting ideas, colors, fonts and images to create a
          <a href="media/moodboard.jpg" target="_blank">moodboard.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing the design prototype in Figma I started building the
          page with HTML. I wrote HTML for all pages before adding any CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>PERSONAL EVALUATION</h3>
        <p>
          I think I had some good ideas with this project, however the end
          product fell just a bit short. The sizing and placement on the
          page makes it feel crowded. The website is also somewhat disorienting.
        </p>
        <p>Although the current content layout needs som adjustments I think the overal idea has good potential.</p>
        <p>
          I am quite satisfied with the color design. I tried to focus on the target audience being a younger age-group and
          therefore include a lot of color to hopefully create a eyecatching
          effect and make it more attractive.
        </p>
        <h3>GOING FORWARD</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to get feedback from users in the target age-group. So in the future I aim to base my work more on relevant user-feedback.</p>
        <p>I want to further improve my skill in CSS and write more neat code.</p>
        <p>I think I would've liked to separate the
          different sections a bit more clearly and create more room for the
          page to "breath".</p>

        <p>HTML CSS</p>
        <h3>TASK</h3>
        <p>
          Time: 2 weeks<br />
          Create a functioning website that includes multiple pages and is
          responsive across multiple devices.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Include at least the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage</li>
          <li>Products page</li>

          <li>Checkout success page</li>
          <li>About page</li>
        </ul> -->
        <h3>PROCESS</h3>
        <p>
          This project was a continuation from a series of previous projects including
          <a href="media/rdmoodboard.jpg" target="_blank">moodboard</a>, <a href="media/rdstyletile.jpg" target="_blank">style tile</a> and a prototype in Figma. So with that I could start
          building the website right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created and wrote all HTML before adding any CSS. I did spend some time
          trying to figure out how to replicate javascript functionality with
          plain CSS. 
        </p>
        <h3>PERSONAL EVALUATION</h3>
        <p>
          Some questionable decisions were made. Like making the
          top line in the header disappear when scrolling in order to save
          10px worth of space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation system in the shop on mobile version had potential but the current version needs work. Taking less space and not cover the other content on the page would be a good start. Preferably using javascript to increase in size and visibility only when interacted with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some parts and pages feels unfinished. Hover-effects have poor contrast and content
          alignment has inconsistencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am quite satisfied with the color and typography design. I wanted the website to have a certain "earthy" feeling to it. Rather than a typical clean and modern look I wished to make the website hold a more intimate and cozy feeling.
        </p>
        <h3>GOING FORWARD</h3>
        <p>
        I decided to do some big last minute changes and it caused a lot of
        trouble. So I learned to be careful with adjustments and got
        better at knowing what to watch out for when altering HTML and CSS.
        </p>
          <p>With Javascript I could pull the product list from an API and create a better solution for sorting products accordingly. I would make the website more smooth by adding animations.</p>
          <p>Other than that I would like to further improve upon the points mentioned under Self Assessment.</p>
