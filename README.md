# Process and results

I created a simple one-page website that gives a short summary of each big project we did during the past year.

The page is not quite finished as there is no functioning links to "contact" or "about". The main goal of this website was just to present my projects, not to create a fully finished portfolio.

Later we will create new complete portfolios.
